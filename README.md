sugar upload
- run this command from just one level outside of the assets folder
- The upload command is essentially saying - "Hey Sugar CLI, take all the NFT pairs in my assets folder, upload them to NFT.storage or whichever storage I configured in config.js, initialize the candy machine config holding the pointers to these NFT"

sugar deploy
- Now that all my NFTs are uploaded to NFT.Storage, Sugar should generate a cache.json file
  - It should contain the link to each of the images that was uploaded to NFT.Storage
- run this command to deploy our NFTs on-chain

sugar verify
- run this command to verify my NFTs were actually uploaded
