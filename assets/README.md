In the assets we are going to have pairs of files that are associated to each other — the actual NFT asset (in our case, an image) and a json file with the metadata for that specific NFT that Metaplex needs to set everything up on our behalf.

You can load as many NFTs as you want in this machine, but we are going to start with just three to get you familiar with everything thats needed.

To keep track of which asset goes with each json metadata we want to give it a really simple naming convention — numbers! Each PNG is paired with it's own JSON file. Two things to note:

You need to start at 0.
There can be no gaps in the naming.
